## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 **Kali Linux**  
- 💣 **Metasploit Framework**  
- 🔎 **Nessus Vulnerability Scanner**  
- 💻 **Oracle VirtualBox**  
- 🌐 **OWASP Broken Web Apps / Bitnami WordPress VM**

## 📋 Key Findings

### 🐛 Vulnerabilities Identified:
- **SQL Injection**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**
- **Outdated Web Server / CMS Software**

### ⚙️ Exploitation Methods:
- `sqlmap` used to automate SQLi and extract credentials  
- XSS scripts to hijack sessions  
- Metasploit modules for known WordPress plugin exploits

## 🔐 Learning Outcomes

- Performed full end-to-end web application penetration testing
- Used real-world offensive security tools in a safe, controlled lab
- Understood the ethical and responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities
- Recommended mitigation strategies including patching and secure input validation
